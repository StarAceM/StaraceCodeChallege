# Starace Code Challenge

- Problem
  - Solution
    - Todo 
    
1) Retrieve data from url and add data to java objects
  - I chose to use Retrofit to solve this becuase I am already familiar with it and it is a simple solution for a simple problem
    - I could have done more to handle errors if they would occur. I just added a simple toast to alert the user of an error getting the         data 
    
2) Display your objects in a RecyclerView
  - I chose a basic recyclerView implementation again because it felt like the correct solution given the scope of the problem
    - The implementation of the recyclerView could be done in more generic way inorder to give the adapter and the view more reusability.       also more time could have been spent to improve the UI and make it look prettier. Also the implementation could be refactored to           handle more possible null values returned by the api
    
3) Display an image from url
  - I went with Picasso for this because I am most familiar with it and I knew it would handle the resize as well
    - I am sure there are other more efficient ways of handling images but that would have taken reserach on my part and that seemed              outside of the scope of the challenge.
    
    Thanks for the opportunity
